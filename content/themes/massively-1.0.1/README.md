# Massively

This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image and scroll effects powered by Scrollex. Originally created by [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn) for [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) and later ported to [Ghost](https://ghost.org)

# First time using a Ghost theme?

Ghost uses a simple templating language called [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for its themes.

We've documented our default theme pretty heavily so that it should be fairly easy to work out what's going on just by reading the code and the comments. Once you feel comfortable with how everything works, we also have full [theme API documentation](https://themes.ghost.org) which explains every possible Handlebars helper and template.

**The main files are:**

- `default.hbs` - The main template file
- `index.hbs` - Used for the home page
- `post.hbs` - Used for individual posts
- `page.hbs` - Used for individual pages
- `tag.hbs` - Used for tag archives
- `author.hbs` - Used for author archives

One neat trick is that you can also create custom one-off templates just by adding the slug of a page to a template file. For example:

- `page-about.hbs` - Custom template for the `/about/` page
- `tag-news.hbs` - Custom template for `/tag/news/` archive
- `author-ali.hbs` - Custom template for `/author/ali/` archive


# Development

This implementation tries to stay as true as possible to the original template without making too many modifications. The original code is unmodified, preserving the ability to update it later.

There are two main changes compared to the original template files:

- The original template contained separate `/assets` and `/images` directories. Ghost Themes require that all assets be nested under a top-level `/assets` directory, so these are moved to `/assets/main` and `/assets/images`, respectively.
- In order to make minor modifications and add some new custom styles, one additional SaSS file is added under `/assets/main/sass/layout/ghost.sass` and included at the bottom of the `main.sass` file.

To work on styles in this theme, you'll need to run a local development environment to build/watch for changes. Once cloned and installed with npm/yarn, the following `gulp` build tasks are available:

```bash
# Build files locally and watch for changes
gulp

# Build production zip locally and save to /dist
gulp zip

# Run compatibility test against latest version of Ghost
yarn test
```

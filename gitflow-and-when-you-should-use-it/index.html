                    <p>There are a lot of people explaining <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">GitFlow</a> in different blog posts and videos. I could not find one that, using the correct arguments, explained what it is good for. These are my personal opinions and you don't have to agree =)</p>
<p><em>GitFlow</em> is really the simplest thing. Let's divide the people working with a project into 2 different roles, <strong>developers</strong> and <strong>configuration manager(s)</strong>, and look at what they do.</p>
<h1 id="gitflowasadeveloper">GitFlow as a developer</h1>
<p>As a <strong>developer</strong> you have 2 kinds of branches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>develop</strong> Integration branch. Refers to the <em>next release</em>.</li>
<li><strong>feature/X</strong> Feature branch where feature <em>X</em> is developed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have <strong>feature</strong> branches that branch out of other <strong>feature</strong> branches. In order to, easily, collaborate with other developers on a larger feature. You may call that large feature branch, <strong>integration</strong> branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should always merge code to <strong>develop</strong> as fast as you can. To spread commits quick and avoid merge conflicts.</li>
<li>You should regularly <em>rebase</em>, or <em>merge</em>, <strong>develop</strong> into you <strong>feature</strong> branch. To base you code on the latest features and refactorings and avoid merge conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<p>To work on the next release. You branch out of <strong>develop</strong>, work with the <strong>feature</strong>, merge back to <strong>develop</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>*    (develop)  Merge branch 'feature/work-with-correcting-a' into develop 
|\  
| *  (feature/work-with-correcting-a) Correcting a
|/  
*     Merge branch 'feature/work-with-a' into develop 
|\  
| *  (feature/work-with-a)  a 
|/  
* 
</code></pre>
<p>To work on the <em>next</em>-<em>next</em> release, or even further into the future, simply don't merge it back to <strong>develop</strong> before <em>next</em>-<em>next</em> is <em>next</em>. And keep in mind, it may be a good idea to merge it into <strong>develop</strong> earlier, to avoid merge conflicts, if you can do feature toggling.</p>
<p>As a <strong>developer</strong>, this is all there is to it! This is how <strong>developers</strong> most often prefer to work. Just look at any open source repository. Most often you fork the main repository and the <strong>master</strong> in your fork is your <strong>feature</strong> branch. But still, <strong>this is as simple as it can get and this is how developers do it!</strong></p>
<h1 id="gitflowasaconfigurationmanager">GitFlow as a configuration manager</h1>
<p>As a <strong>configuration manager</strong> you have 2 kinds of branches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>master</strong> This is the what's in <strong>production</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>release-X</strong> This is what's included in <strong>release</strong> <em>X</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as it's <em>code freeze</em> it's time to create the first <em>release candidate</em>. That is done by branching out of <strong>develop</strong> into <strong>release-X</strong>. The version of <strong>develop</strong> is now set to 1.1, in Java that would mean changing the version to <em>1.1-SNAPSHOT</em> while in the release branch its still <em>1.0-SNAPSHOT</em>. The semantics of the versions is a side track, but I can recommend <a href="http://kylelieber.com/2012/06/maven-versioning-strategy/">this blog post</a>.</p>
<pre><code>| *  (release-1, tag: 1.0-RC-1) Releasing RC 1
| *  Setting version to 1.0-RC1
* | (develop) Setting version to 1.1-SNAPSHOT
|/
</code></pre>
<p>The whole point of the <strong>release-X</strong> branch is to provide a <em>code freeze</em> for the release. The <strong>developers</strong> can continue their work exactly as described above. Most Git services allows you to define permissions per branch and only configuration managers should have permission to <strong>release-X</strong>.</p>
<p>The release candidate, <em>RC1</em>, is deployed and tested and if it's all good then it's released. But there is probably something that needs to be fixed. It can be done in different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With <em>cherry-picking</em> from <strong>develop</strong>.<br>
This is the prettiest but it may also not be possible. Merge conflicts may hinder this. There is also a risk that the <strong>develop</strong>-branch is too far ahead making it hard to know if the fix will work once it's in the <strong>release</strong>-branch. But I feel that it gives the <strong>configuration manager</strong> the most control of the release process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With merging a <strong>feature</strong>-branch that branches out of the <strong>release</strong>-branch.<br>
This often my preferred choice in large teams. It gives the <strong>configuration manager</strong> control of what's included in the release. It avoids risk of merge conflicts. The tests done on that <strong>feature</strong>-branch can be trusted. It can be done with pull requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With direct commits to the <strong>release</strong>-branch.<br>
This may fit a technical team where the <strong>configuration manager</strong> is also a <strong>developer</strong>. It provides a release process for the current release and enables the <strong>developer</strong> to work on the next release in <strong>develop</strong>. It lacks support for code review but you may not need that in a small project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is what it may look like if <em>cherry-picking</em> is used.</p>
<pre><code>| *  Setting version to 1.0-SNAPSHOT
| *  (release-1, tag: 1.0-RC-2) Releasing RC 2
| *  Setting version to 1.0-RC2
| *  Correcting a
| *  Setting version to 1.0-SNAPSHOT
| *  (tag: 1.0-RC-1) Releasing RC 1
| *  Setting version to 1.0-RC1
* | (develop) Setting version to 1.1-SNAPSHOT
|/
</code></pre>
<p>Now if <em>RC2</em> is good and should be released then that exact artifact is deployed in production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Released commit, <strong>release-tag</strong>, in <strong>release-1</strong> is merged into <strong>master</strong>.
<ul>
<li>To keep track of what is in production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>master</strong> is merged into <strong>develop</strong>, this is important:
<ul>
<li>To make sure any changes made in production are also in the next release.</li>
<li>To allow a <em>fast-forward</em> of <strong>master</strong> next time you merge <strong>release-tag</strong> to <strong>master</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>I've shown the two roles in <em>GitFlow</em> and I hope I made it obvious that its actually a very simple workflow! It will not fit all projects.</p>
<p>You will probably <strong>not gain from using <em>GitFLow</em></strong> in a library. That is just used by other software. Where a release is just a process of packaging an artifact an making it available for other software to use. You can probably just release a new version if something needs to be fixed later, and the users of the software can just keep using an older version until things are worked out.</p>
<p>You will probably <strong>gain from using <em>GitFlow</em></strong> if you have a <em>code freeze</em>. It enables a <em>code freeze</em> without preventing developers from working on the next release.</p>
<p>If you just fire releases from <em>master</em>, without any branching, you can easily automate that process. If you need to make a release-branch and eventually merge it back into <em>master</em>, and <em>develop</em>, you will need a more complex flow. Which is a price you may not want to pay unless you are gaining something else from the flow!</p>
